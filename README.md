# Movie Listings

A simple frontend app that allows the user to filter a list of movies on genre and rating.

The application was built using Node v14.15.0 and NPM v6.14.8.

Project scaffolding provided by [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) [webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) - although this should not be required to build and run the app.

The project uses vanilla JavaScript and Gulp to build.

## Installation
Install: `$ npm install`

Run: `$ npm start`

Build: `$ npm run build`

Run dist code: `$ npm run serve:dist`

## Browsers
The app has been tested on Firefox 85, Chrome 88 and Edge 88. It does not currently work on IE11, although this could be polyfilled.

## Notes and observations
The Brief specified that movies should be presented in popularity order, having added a sort function to do this, the order did not appear to change - so I've omitted that from the final code.

I'm not a graphic designer, so I apologise if it looks a bit ropey.
